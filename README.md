# dumber [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dumberjs/dumber.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dumberjs/dumber)

A dumb JavasScript bundler for Single Page Application, dumber than you and me.

End users don't use this package directly, dumber is designed to be consumed through [gulp-dumber](https://github.com/dumberjs/gulp-dumber) and dumberify (TBD).

status: extremely alpha

TODO: docs and examples
