# dumber ![CI](https://github.com/dumberjs/dumber/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

A dumb JavasScript bundler for Single Page Application, dumber than you and me.

**Document site (80% completed)**: https://dumber.js.org

You won't normally use this package directly, dumber is designed to be consumed through [gulp-dumber](https://github.com/dumberjs/gulp-dumber) or dumberify (TBD).

Check out early examples of gulp-dumber in action https://github.com/dumberjs/examples

Use "makes" to create new SPA project (Aurelia/React/Vue) using dumber bundler.

```bash
npx makes dumberjs
```
