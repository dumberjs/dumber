# dumber [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dumberjs/dumber.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dumberjs/dumber)

A dumb JavasScript bundler for Single Page Application, dumber than you and me.

You won't normally use this package directly, dumber is designed to be consumed through [gulp-dumber](https://github.com/dumberjs/gulp-dumber) or dumberify (TBD).

Check out early examples of gulp-dumber in action https://github.com/dumberjs/examples
